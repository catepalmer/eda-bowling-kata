# Bowling kata

Enspiral Dev Academy Bowling Kata - Ruru 2018. A challenge asking students to write the logic to score a game of ten pin 
bowling. I decided to rework this exercise during my revision after graduation and to include a new version of the 
repo (without the EDA ReadMe) on my own GitHub page.


## Rules of bowling

 * Each player usually gets two balls per **frame**. There are ten frames.
 * If a player knocks down all the pins with _one_ ball, that's a **strike**.
   * A strike scores ten points _plus the score for the next two balls_.
 * If a player knocks down all the pins with _two_ balls, that's a **spare**.
   * A spare scores ten points _plus the score for the next ball_. 
 * If a player doesn't knock down all the pins in a frame, they just get one point for each pin they do manage to knock down.
 * On the tenth frame, if the first two balls contain a strike or make a spare, the player gets a third ball.
 * The maximum possible score (a "perfect game" of all strikes) is 300.
